  "description": "# SIP5.2: Multi-Chain AdmiralsQuarters Role Setup\n\n## Summary\nThis proposal grants the ADMIRALS_QUARTERS_ROLE to newly deployed AdmiralsQuarters contracts across all active chains in the Lazy Summer Protocol ecosystem.\n\n## Motivation\nThe AdmiralsQuarters contract requires the ADMIRALS_QUARTERS_ROLE in the ProtocolAccessManager to operate properly. This role is necessary for the contract to unstake and withdraw assets from fleets on behalf of users.\n\nNewly deployed AdmiralsQuarters contracts:\n- base: 0x08E19585548c8439E83239BBED99aFc8e28528C6\n- arbitrum: 0x8423c38AF6B70D27d613c17595e1110b25d3a983\n\n## Specifications\n\n### Actions\n1. On base: \n   - Grant ADMIRALS_QUARTERS_ROLE to AdmiralsQuarters at 0x08E19585548c8439E83239BBED99aFc8e28528C6\n2. Send cross-chain proposal to arbitrum to:\n   - Grant ADMIRALS_QUARTERS_ROLE to AdmiralsQuarters at 0x8423c38AF6B70D27d613c17595e1110b25d3a983\n\n## Technical Details\nThe ADMIRALS_QUARTERS_ROLE is defined in the ProtocolAccessManager contract and is specifically designed for the AdmiralsQuarters contract. This role enables the contract to perform unstaking and withdrawal operations from fleets on behalf of users.\n\nWhen a user interacts with the AdmiralsQuarters interface to withdraw assets from fleets, the contract uses this role to execute the necessary transactions, ensuring a streamlined user experience while maintaining proper access controls.",
