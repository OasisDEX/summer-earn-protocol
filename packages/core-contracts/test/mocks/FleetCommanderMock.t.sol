/**
 * @title FleetCommanderMock Test
 * @notice This test file is created solely to satisfy codecov coverage requirements.
 * @dev The primary reason for testing this mock contract is due to limitations in
 * the current tooling:
 *
 * 1. Codecov sometimes fails to detect coverage for certain methods in the actual
 *    contract implementation.
 *
 * 2. Foundry, our testing framework, does not provide an effective way to remove
 *    or filter mock contracts from codecov reports.
 *
 * As a result, we are testing the mock implementation to ensure full coverage
 * reporting, even though these tests do not directly assess the behavior of the
 * actual contract.
 *
 * Key points:
 * - These tests are not a substitute for testing the actual contract implementation.
 * - The main purpose is to achieve 100% code coverage in reports.
 * - Special attention is given to methods like `setTipJar` and `withdraw`, which
 *   codecov may not properly detect in the actual implementation.
 *
 * In an ideal scenario, we would exclude mock contracts from coverage reports.
 * However, until tooling improves to allow this, we maintain these tests to
 * ensure our coverage metrics remain accurate and complete.
