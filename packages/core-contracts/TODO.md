TODO: ArkFactory for each protocol? 
~~TODO: Shall we use upgrade-ability?~~
TODO: Remove or disconnect an ark?
TODO: In `FleetCommander` - check if we want to handle this `  uint256 amountToMove = (data.amount < remainingExcess)` as is - or validate offchain data - how to handle this? Maybe some buffor we always go below buffor - or maybe we should leave it as is?
TODO: In `FleetCommander` make the rebalance from buffor more explicitely visible - maybe add a comment or a function?
