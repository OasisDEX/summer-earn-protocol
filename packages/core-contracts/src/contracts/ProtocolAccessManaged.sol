/**
 * @title ProtocolAccessManager
 * @notice This contract is the central authority for access control within the protocol.
 * It defines and manages various roles that govern different aspects of the system.
 *
 * @dev This contract extends LimitedAccessControl, which restricts direct role management.
 * Roles are typically assigned during deployment or through governance proposals.
 *
 * The contract defines four main roles:
 * 1. GOVERNOR_ROLE: System-wide administrators
 * 2. KEEPER_ROLE: Routine maintenance operators
 * 3. SUPER_KEEPER_ROLE: Advanced maintenance operators
 * 4. COMMANDER_ROLE: Managers of specific protocol components (Arks)
 *
 * Role Hierarchy and Management:
 * - The GOVERNOR_ROLE is at the top of the hierarchy and can manage all other roles.
 * - Other roles cannot manage roles directly due to LimitedAccessControl restrictions.
 * - Role assignments are typically done through governance proposals or during initial setup.
 *
 * Usage in the System:
 * - Other contracts in the system inherit from ProtocolAccessManaged, which checks permissions
 *   against this ProtocolAccessManager.
 * - Critical functions in various contracts are protected by role-based modifiers
 *   (e.g., onlyGovernor, onlyKeeper, etc.) which query this contract for permissions.
 *
 * Security Considerations:
 * - The GOVERNOR_ROLE has significant power and should be managed carefully, potentially
 *   through a multi-sig wallet or governance contract.
 * - The SUPER_KEEPER_ROLE has elevated privileges and should be assigned judiciously.
 * - The COMMANDER_ROLE is not directly manageable through this contract but is used
 *   in other parts of the system for specific access control.
