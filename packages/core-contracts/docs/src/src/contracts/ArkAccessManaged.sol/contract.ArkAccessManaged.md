[Git Source](https://github.com/OasisDEX/summer-earn-protocol/blob/f5de2d90d66614e7bd59fd42a9d06b870fe474cd/src/contracts/ArkAccessManaged.sol)

**Inherits:**
[IArkAccessManaged](/src/interfaces/IArkAccessManaged.sol/interface.IArkAccessManaged.md), [ProtocolAccessManaged](/src/contracts/ProtocolAccessManaged.sol/contract.ProtocolAccessManaged.md), [LimitedAccessControl](/src/contracts/LimitedAccessControl.sol/contract.LimitedAccessControl.md)

Extends the ProtocolAccessManaged contract with Ark specific AccessControl
Used to specifically tie one FleetCommander to each Ark

*One Ark specific role is defined:
- Commander: is the fleet commander contract itself and couples an
Ark to specific Fleet Commander
The Commander role is still declared on the access manager to centralise
role definitions.*
