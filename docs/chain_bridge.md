# ChainBridge Module - Technical Documentation

## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 Overview
The ChainBridge Module enables secure cross-chain asset transfers for the Summer Protocol by providing a standardized interface to multiple third-party bridge providers. It abstracts away the complexities of different bridge implementations while acknowledging that these bridges ultimately take custody of the assets during transfer.

### 1.2 Component Structure
The ChainBridge module consists of two primary components:

- **BridgeRouter**
  - Provides a unified entry point for cross-chain transfers
  - Queries and selects appropriate bridge adapters based on requirements
  - Manages fee estimation and approval processes
  - Tracks the status of cross-chain operations

- **BridgeAdapters**
  - Interfaces with specific third-party bridge protocols (LayerZero, Axelar, etc.)
  - Manages the custody transfer to the bridge contracts
  - Handles bridge-specific transaction formatting and requirements
  - Provides fee estimation for their respective bridge providers
  - Implements provider-specific receiver interfaces for incoming transfers
  - Validates and processes incoming bridge messages
  - Routes received assets to their intended recipients

### 1.3 Bridge Adapter System

    D3 --> E3["Other Bridge Contracts"]
    E1 -.-> D1
    E2 -.-> D2
    E3 -.-> D3
```

The adapter system enables:

- **Bridge Selection**: Choose different bridge providers based on cost, speed, or reliability
- **Provider Redundancy**: Fallback to alternative providers if primary option fails
- **Consistent Interface**: Applications use a unified API regardless of underlying bridge
- **Future Extensibility**: New bridge protocols can be added without changing core logic

### 1.4 Cross-Chain Asset Transfer Flow

    G --> H["Destination Application"]
```

## 2. Bridge Adapter System

### 2.1 Bridge Selection Process
The BridgeRouter implements a straightforward selection process:

1. **Query Available Adapters**
   - Filter adapters that support the source and destination chains
   - Filter adapters that support the asset being transferred

2. **Get Fee Estimates**
   - Request fee estimates from each eligible adapter
   - Fees typically include gas costs on both chains and protocol fees

3. **Select Adapter**
   - Based on user preference (lowest cost, fastest, most reliable)
   - Apply default selection criteria if no preference specified

4. **Execute Transfer**
   - Approve the selected bridge to spend tokens
   - Initiate the transfer through the adapter

### 2.2 Bridge Adapters

#### LayerZero Adapter
- **Integration**: Interfaces with LayerZero bridge contracts (often Stargate for assets)
- **Token Handling**: Approves and transfers tokens to LayerZero's custody
- **Fee Structure**: Manages LayerZero's gas fees plus protocol fees
- **Chains Supported**: All chains with LayerZero endpoints
- **Receiver Implementation**: Implements ILayerZeroReceiver for receiving messages

#### Axelar Adapter
- **Integration**: Interfaces with Axelar Gateway and Gas Service
- **Token Handling**: Locks tokens in Axelar's custody contracts
- **Fee Structure**: Manages Axelar's gas service fees
- **Chains Supported**: All chains with Axelar Gateway deployments
- **Receiver Implementation**: Implements IAxelarExecutable for receiving messages

### 2.3 Adapter Interface
All bridge adapters implement a standardized interface:

```solidity
interface IBridgeAdapter {
    // Sending functions
    function transferAsset(
        uint16 destinationChainId,
        address asset,
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 gasLimit,
        bytes calldata adapterParams
    ) external payable returns (bytes32 transferId);
    
    function estimateFee(
        uint16 destinationChainId,
        address asset,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 gasLimit,
        bytes calldata adapterParams
    ) external view returns (uint256 nativeFee, uint256 tokenFee);
    
    // Status and capability functions
    function getTransferStatus(bytes32 transferId)
        external view returns (TransferStatus);
        
    function getSupportedChains() 
        external view returns (uint16[] memory);
        
    function getSupportedAssets(uint16 chainId)
        external view returns (address[] memory);
        
    // Each adapter also implements its bridge-specific receiver interface
    // (Not shown here - e.g., ILayerZeroReceiver, IAxelarExecutable, etc.)
}

enum TransferStatus {
    UNKNOWN,
    PENDING,
    DELIVERED,
    FAILED
}
```

## 3. Security Considerations

### 3.1 Security Model
The ChainBridge implements a focused security approach:

1. **Asset Security**
   - Carefully controlled token approvals to bridge contracts
   - Rate limiting to prevent excessive transfers
   - Value caps based on bridge security profiles
   - Monitoring of bridge provider status

2. **Message Verification**
   - Each adapter validates incoming bridge callbacks
   - Provider-specific verification of message authenticity
   - Prevents replay of bridge messages
   - Ensures only authorized contracts can process received assets

3. **Recovery Mechanisms**
   - Handles failed or incomplete transfers
   - Provides retry functionality for interrupted operations
   - Implements emergency pause capabilities

### 3.2 Bridge Provider Risks

Each bridge provider has its own security model and risks:

- **Custody Risks**: Bridge providers take custody of assets during transfer
- **Centralization Risks**: Some bridges rely on validator networks or centralized components
- **Smart Contract Risks**: Vulnerabilities in bridge contracts can affect assets
- **Liquidity Risks**: Some bridges depend on liquidity pools on destination chains

The ChainBridge mitigates these through:
- Multiple bridge provider options
- Configurable transfer limits per bridge
- Careful monitoring of bridge status

## 4. Integration with OmniArk

### 4.1 OmniArk Integration
The ChainBridge provides OmniArk with:

1. **Asset Transfer Capabilities**
   - Enables sending assets between OmniArks on different chains
   - Provides status tracking for in-flight transfers
   - Handles the complexity of bridge interactions

2. **Standardized Interface**
   - OmniArk uses a consistent method regardless of underlying bridge
   - Bridge-specific details are abstracted away
   - Fee estimation is provided for user transparency

### 4.2 Asset Transfer Flow for OmniArk

## 5. Implementation Interfaces

### 5.1 Core Interfaces

```solidity
interface IBridgeRouter {
    function transferAsset(
        uint16 destinationChainId,
        address asset,
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount,
        BridgeOptions memory options
    ) external payable returns (bytes32 transferId);
    
    function estimateFee(
        uint16 destinationChainId,

        external view returns (TransferStatus);
}

interface IMessageReceiver {

        address sourceAddress,
        bytes calldata payload,
        bytes calldata proof
    ) external returns (bool success);
}

struct BridgeOptions {
    address feeToken;           // Token to use for fees (address(0) for native)
    uint8 bridgePreference;     // 0: lowest cost, 1: fastest, 2: most secure
    uint256 gasLimit;           // Gas limit for execution on destination
    address refundAddress;      // Address to refund excess fees
    bytes adapterParams;        // Bridge-specific parameters
}
```

## 6. OmniArk Integration

### 6.1 OmniArk Bridge Functions

```solidity
// In OmniArk contract
function sendCrossChain(
    uint256 amount,
    uint16 destinationChainId,
    address recipient
) external onlyCommander returns (bytes32 transferId) {
    // Validate parameters
    if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
    if (recipient == address(0)) revert InvalidRecipient();
    
    // Approve bridge router to spend tokens
    config.asset.approve(bridgeRouter, amount);
    
    // Call bridge router to initiate transfer
    BridgeOptions memory options = BridgeOptions({
        feeToken: address(0),  // Use native token for fees
        bridgePreference: 0,   // Use lowest cost bridge
        gasLimit: 500000,      // Standard gas limit
        refundAddress: address(this),
        adapterParams: ""
    });
    
    transferId = IBridgeRouter(bridgeRouter).transferAsset(
        destinationChainId,
        address(config.asset),
        recipient,
        amount,
        options
    );
    
    // Record the transfer
    transferStatuses[transferId] = TransferStatus.PENDING;
    
    emit CrossChainTransferInitiated(transferId, amount, recipient, destinationChainId);
    return transferId;
}

function receiveCrossChain(
    uint256 amount,
    address sender,
    uint16 sourceChainId,
    bytes32 transferId
) external {
    // Verify caller is the bridge adapter
    if (!bridgeRouter.isValidAdapter(msg.sender)) revert CallerNotBridge();
    
    // Process received assets
    // ... processing logic
    
    emit CrossChainTransferReceived(transferId, amount, sender, sourceChainId);
}
```
