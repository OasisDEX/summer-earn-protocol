# ChainBridge Module - Technical Documentation

## 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 Overview
The ChainBridge Module enables secure cross-chain messaging and asset transfers for the Summer Protocol by providing a standardized interface to multiple third-party bridge providers. It abstracts away the complexities of different bridge implementations while creating a consistent interface for cross-chain operations.

### 1.2 Component Structure
The ChainBridge module consists of three primary components:

- **BridgeRouter**
  - Provides a unified entry point for all cross-chain operations
  - Routes messages between chains through appropriate bridge adapters
  - Manages adapter registration and selection
  - Tracks the status of cross-chain operations
  - Acts as the first receiver for all incoming cross-chain messages

- **BridgeAdapters**
  - Interface with specific third-party bridge protocols (LayerZero, Chainlink CCIP)
  - Translate between standardized message format and bridge-specific formats
  - Handle bridge-specific requirements for message passing
  - Implement provider-specific receiver interfaces for incoming messages
  - Provide fee estimation for their respective bridge providers

- **CrossChainReceivers**
  - Contracts that implement ICrossChainReceiver to receive cross-chain messages
  - Process incoming assets, messages, and data from other chains
  - May include specialized proxies for remote contracts (e.g., Ark Proxies)

```

The adapter system enables:

- **Unified Message Format**: All applications use a consistent message format
- **Bridge Selection**: Choose different bridge providers based on cost, speed, or reliability
- **Provider Redundancy**: Fallback to alternative providers if primary option fails
- **Future Extensibility**: New bridge protocols can be added without changing core logic

## 2. Cross-Chain Operations

### 2.1 Core Operations
The ChainBridge module supports three primary cross-chain operations:

1. **Asset Transfers**
   - Send assets from one chain to another
   - Destination receives assets via the `receiveAssets` function
   - Full tracking of transfer status throughout the process

2. **Message Passing**
   - Send arbitrary messages to contracts on other chains
   - Messages received via the `receiveMessage` function
   - Enables complex cross-chain operations beyond simple transfers

3. **State Reading**
   - Request state information from contracts on other chains
   - Results delivered asynchronously via `receiveStateRead` function
   - Allows cross-chain awareness without moving assets

### 2.2 Bridge Selection Process
The BridgeRouter implements a sophisticated selection process:

1. **Filter Available Adapters**
   - Identify adapters that support the source and destination chains
   - For asset transfers, check which adapters support the specific asset

2. **Get Fee Estimates**
   - Request fee estimates from each eligible adapter
   - Fees typically include gas costs on both chains and protocol fees

3. **Select Adapter**
   - Based on user preference (lowest cost, fastest, most reliable)
   - Apply default selection criteria if no preference specified

4. **Execute Operation**
   - Prepare message in standardized format
   - Pass to selected adapter for delivery to the destination chain

### 2.3 Bridge Adapters

#### LayerZero Adapter
- **Integration**: Interfaces with LayerZero endpoint
- **Message Format**: Converts standard messages to LayerZero format
- **Fee Structure**: Manages LayerZero's gas fees
- **Chains Supported**: All chains with LayerZero endpoints
- **Receiver Implementation**: Implements ILayerZeroReceiver for incoming messages

#### Chainlink Adapter
- **Integration**: Interfaces with Chainlink CCIP Router
- **Message Format**: Converts standard messages to CCIP format
- **Fee Structure**: Manages Chainlink's fee payments
- **Chains Supported**: All chains with CCIP router deployments
- **Receiver Implementation**: Implements CCIPReceiver for incoming messages

### 2.4 Adapter Interface
All bridge adapters implement the standardized IBridgeAdapter interface:

```solidity
interface IBridgeAdapter {
    // Core sending functions
    function transferAsset(
        uint16 destinationChainId,
        address asset,
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 gasLimit,
        bytes calldata adapterParams
    ) external payable returns (bytes32 transferId);
    
    function estimateFee(
        uint16 destinationChainId,
        address asset,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 gasLimit,
        bytes calldata adapterParams
    ) external view returns (uint256 nativeFee, uint256 tokenFee);
    
    // Status and capability functions
    function getTransferStatus(bytes32 transferId)
        external view returns (TransferStatus);
        
    function getSupportedChains() 
        external view returns (uint16[] memory);
        
    function getSupportedAssets(uint16 chainId)
        external view returns (address[] memory);
}
```

## 3. Receiver Model

### 3.1 ICrossChainReceiver Interface
Contracts that want to receive cross-chain messages implement the ICrossChainReceiver interface:

```solidity
interface ICrossChainReceiver {
    function receiveAssets(
        address asset,
        uint256 amount,
        address sender,
        uint16 sourceChainId,
        bytes32 transferId,
        bytes calldata extraData
    ) external;
    
    function receiveMessage(
        bytes calldata message,
        address sender,
        uint16 sourceChainId,
        bytes32 messageId
    ) external;
    
    function receiveStateRead(
        bytes calldata resultData,
        address requestor,
        uint16 sourceChainId,
        bytes32 requestId
    ) external;
}
```

### 3.2 Ark Proxy Model
For cross-chain OmniArk operations, we implement an Ark Proxy model:

1. **Deployment**: Each remote OmniArk is represented by a lightweight proxy on the destination chain
2. **Ownership**: The proxy owns assets and positions on behalf of the remote OmniArk
3. **Message Handling**: The proxy implements ICrossChainReceiver to handle instructions from its parent OmniArk
4. **Clean Accounting**: Provides clear ownership boundaries and simplified accounting for cross-chain assets

```

    D -->|interacts with| E["Fleet (Chain B)"]
    D -->|owns positions in| E
```

## 4. Security Considerations

### 4.1 Security Model
The ChainBridge implements a layered security approach:

1. **Message Validation**
   - Each adapter validates incoming bridge messages
   - Provider-specific verification of message authenticity
   - Only registered adapters can update message status
   - BridgeRouter validates all incoming messages before forwarding

2. **Access Control**
   - Only the BridgeRouter can invoke certain adapter functions
   - Only registered adapters can deliver messages to receivers
   - Permissions are enforced at each layer of the stack

3. **Recovery Mechanisms**
   - Handles failed or incomplete transfers
   - Provides retry functionality for interrupted operations
   - Implements emergency pause capabilities

### 4.2 Bridge Provider Risks

Each bridge provider has its own security model and risks:

- **Consensus Risks**: Different bridges use different consensus mechanisms
- **Relayer Risks**: Some bridges rely on off-chain relayers
- **Smart Contract Risks**: Vulnerabilities in bridge contracts can affect messages
- **Network Risks**: Bridge performance depends on underlying network stability

The ChainBridge mitigates these through:
- Multiple bridge provider options
- Configurable message limits per bridge
- Careful monitoring of bridge status

## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1 BridgeRouter Functions

```solidity
interface IBridgeRouter {
    function transferAsset(
        uint16 destinationChainId,
        address asset,
        address recipient,
        uint256 amount,
        BridgeTypes.BridgeOptions calldata options
    ) external payable returns (bytes32 transferId);
    
    function sendMessage(
        uint16 destinationChainId,
        address targetContract,
        bytes calldata message,
        BridgeTypes.BridgeOptions calldata options
    ) external payable returns (bytes32 messageId);
    
    function readState(
        uint16 sourceChainId,
        address sourceContract,
        bytes4 functionSelector, 
        bytes calldata params,
        BridgeTypes.BridgeOptions calldata options
    ) external payable returns (bytes32 readId);
    
    function estimateFee(
        uint16 destinationChainId,
        address asset,
        uint256 amount,
        BridgeTypes.BridgeOptions calldata options
    ) external view returns (uint256 nativeFee, uint256 tokenFee, address selectedAdapter);
    
    function getTransferStatus(bytes32 transferId)
        external view returns (BridgeTypes.TransferStatus);
        
    function registerAdapter(address adapter)
        external;
        
    function removeAdapter(address adapter)
        external;
}
```

### 5.2 Bridge Options

```solidity
struct BridgeOptions {
    address feeToken;           // Token to use for fees (address(0) for native)
    uint8 bridgePreference;     // 0: lowest cost, 1: fastest, 2: most secure
    uint256 gasLimit;           // Gas limit for execution on destination
    address refundAddress;      // Address to refund excess fees
    bytes adapterParams;        // Bridge-specific parameters
}
```

## 6. OmniArk Integration

### 6.1 Cross-Chain OmniArk Architecture

The OmniArk Cross-Chain architecture uses the ChainBridge to establish presence on multiple chains:

1. **Primary OmniArk**: User's main OmniArk on their home chain
2. **Ark Proxies**: Lightweight proxies on remote chains that:
   - Implement ICrossChainReceiver
   - Represent the OmniArk on that chain
   - Hold positions in the Fleet on behalf of the OmniArk
   - Execute instructions from the primary OmniArk

### 6.2 Cross-Chain Operations

An OmniArk can perform several cross-chain operations:

1. **Asset Transfer**: Move assets between chains
   ```
   OmniArk.transferCrossChain(destinationChainId, asset, amount) 
   → BridgeRouter.transferAsset()
   → [On destination] ArkProxy.receiveAssets()
   ```

2. **Position Management**: Manage Fleet positions on other chains
   ```
   OmniArk.manageCrossChainPosition(destinationChainId, fleetId, action, params)
   → BridgeRouter.sendMessage()
   → [On destination] ArkProxy.receiveMessage() → Fleet.executeAction()
   ```

3. **State Retrieval**: Get information about remote positions
   ```
   OmniArk.readCrossChainState(sourceChainId, fleetId, selector, params)
   → BridgeRouter.readState() 
   → [Response] ArkProxy.receiveStateRead() → OmniArk.updateState()
   ```

### 6.3 Security Model

The cross-chain OmniArk architecture implements a robust security model:

1. **Message Authentication**: All messages between OmniArk and proxies are authenticated
2. **Limited Scope**: Each Ark Proxy can only interact with specific contracts
3. **Recovery Path**: Primary OmniArk can recover assets if a bridge fails
4. **Gradual Migration**: OmniArks can migrate between chains if needed

## 7. Future Extensions
